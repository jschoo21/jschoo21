## About Me
My name is Jacob Schoonenberg and I am currently a third year student in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. Some of the projects
I have worked on while studying here include Satellite Attitude and Determination Control Systems Undergraduate Research, Freshman LTA crafts, 
and several other smaller personal projects. This semester I hope to start an undergraduate research position for Compressible Aerodynamics
and Hypersonics.

Outside of school, a few of my hobbies are collecting vinyl records, making music with my friends, and helping to run the campus radio station
88.5 KURE Ames Alternative. I enjoy all of it due to the fun and easy-going nature of music, which usually provides a much needed break from
school.
